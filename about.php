mainly because I had nothing better to do. And also... you know... because I like to read only what I want to read. :)
</p><p>This is the first version of this app and I am planning to introduce more features like search, charts and reviews in the future. I have the APIs for these. Just the client-side modules and stuffs have to be made. But being such a procrastinator that I am, I just ain't too sure when that will happen.</p>
<p>Well... this app has got more than 250000 news sources categorized into 2500 subcategories. Subscribe to all that interests you and get contents updated whenever any of the sources in your subscribed sub-category posts something. Simple.</p><p>And if you have some suggestions or criticism, you can mail me at <span id='me'>ibtisam.tauhidi@hotmail.com</span>.</p><p>Added [11 Feb, 2010]: This is last modification of the current version. And I am planning a second beta version. So do check back... New features arriving soon.</p><hr />
